# I-X Centre for AI in Science - Resources on Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python (advanced topics)

This repository provides resources for exploring various advanced topics in machine learning and deep learning, including algorithms such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Bayesian Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning. Alongside examples and exercises, external resources are listed to help deepen your understanding or cover foundational concepts. eFor an introduction to PyTorch, used in several of the notebooks below, check out the RCDS course [Deep Learning with Python](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/RCDS-Deep-Learning-CNN) and its references.

## Examples and exercises, Google Colab

Below you will find the links to different notebooks on Google Colab sorted by topic. Links to more notebooks can be found in the folder AIMS2025.
