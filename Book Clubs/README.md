# Book Clubs

This folder contains an overview of book clubs that have take place at the I-X Centre for AI in Science.

## Advanced Topics in ML

We run a book club on Advanced Topics in ML, subdivided into small chunks of 1-6 weeks focusing on individual topics.

### Causal Inference (2025)

The mini-book club was on Causal Inference based on the lecture [Science Before Statistics, Causal Inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNPYUVmY3NM) by Richard McElreath. The course stretched over 4 weeks. Each week, we would meet for a 1-hour session.

**Week 1:**  On "Causal Salad". Before the session, the fellows were asked to watch Science Before Statistics, Causal Inference until 54:50.

**Week 2:**  On "drawing your assumptions". Before the session, fellows were asked to continue watching Science Before Statistics, Causal Inference until 1:58:10.

**Week 3:** One "drawing your assumptions" and "full luxury Bayesian Inference". Before the session, fellows were asked towatch the rest of Science Before Statistics, Causal Inference.

**Week 4:** Based on their preferences, we chose one lecture from [Statistical Rethinking 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs&list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) to dive deeper into one of the topics that we have touched upon during the book club.


### Simulation-based inference (2025)

The mini-book club was on SBI and stretched over 3 weeks. Each week, we would meet for a 1-hour session.

**Week 1:**  We discussed SBI based on the [sbi](https://sbi-dev.github.io/sbi/latest/) python package. Specifically, we discussed the overview in the sections "Home" and “Getting started” and “Implemented algorithms” in "Tutorials and examples". To better understand the abbreviations used in this package, we read the short [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09114, 4 pages) that accompanies the package. Moreover, we discussed that many fellows had already given great tutorials on the topic (see the repository one level up). For those who are interested, further reading material on SBI for different fields were supplied (cf. [[1]](https://simulation-based-inference.org/) and references therein to e.g., elfi, BOLFI).

**Week 2:**  We tried a dynamic format. Fellows were asked to suggest reading material and topics for the second session based on their interest. 

**Week 3:**  As week 2.

### Normalising Flows (2025)

The mini-book club was a one-off session on Normalising Flows. Ahead of the session, fellows reviewed Chapter 18 in [Deep Learning, Foundations and Concepts](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-45468-4) by Bishop. The fellows did not need to read it in detail, but a brief overview will help spark discussions. The session also included a practical, hands-on component where we will explore normalising flows using Pyro (see main repository one level up). 

### Graph Neural Networks (2024)

The mini-book club was on GNNs and stretched over 3 weeks. Each week, we would meet for a 1-hour session.

**Week 1:** Introduction to GNNs based on Chapter 13 in [Deep Learning, Foundations and Concepts](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-45468-4) by Bishop.

**Week 2:** GNN in practice. We went through how to implement GNN in Python based on notebooks on an introductory level (see main repository one level up).

**Week 3:** Discussion of suitable papers (e.g., reviews). Each fellow was encouraged to bring a paper or illustrate how GNN come into play in their own research

The sessions will take the suggested material as their starting point, but, of course, you are all encouraged to share good

## Deep Dive into Deep Learning (2024)

In this book club, we read Chapters 1-12 [Deep Learning, Foundations and Concepts](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-45468-4) by Bishop and Bishop. For each session, we would read one chapter. The book club also entailed a few fellow-led tutorials, e.g., on transformers.

## Deep Dive into Bayesian Statistics (2023-2024)

We followed the course [Statistical Rethinking 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs&list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) by Richard McElreath. In each session, we would discuss roughly 1-hour of online material. The book club also entailed a few fellow-led tutorials, e.g., on [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html).
